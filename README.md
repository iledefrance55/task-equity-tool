# TET - Task Equity Toolâ„¢

*Revolutionary objective measurement of task difficulty*

## What is TET?

The Task Equity Tool provides the first systematic, objective method to measure the TRUE difficulty of any task - from cleaning toilets to leading boardroom meetings. No more subjective "that's easy for you to say" - TET gives you the numbers.

## Why Now?

Post-pandemic, we've all discovered the hidden complexity of everyday tasks. TET brings scientific rigor to task assessment, creating equity in how we value and distribute work.

## The Three Pillars

**TET measures every task across three objective dimensions:**

- ðŸ©¹ **Pain** - Physical discomfort and strain
- ðŸ˜´ **Fatigue** - Mental and emotional exhaustion  
- ðŸ”¥ **Caloric Expenditure** - Actual energy cost

## Personal Handicap Systemâ„¢

Like golf handicaps, TET accounts for individual differences. Your chronic knee pain, your anxiety around phone calls, your height advantage - all factored into your personal TET score.

## Market Opportunity

Our analysis identifies a $50B+ global market hungry for objective task measurement across:
- Workplace equity initiatives
- Household task distribution
- Healthcare and accessibility planning
- Organizational efficiency optimization
