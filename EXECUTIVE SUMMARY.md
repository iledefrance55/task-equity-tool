### The $2 Trillion Hidden Problem

**The pandemic didn't create the workplace crisis‚Äîit exposed it.** Across North America, over 100 million workers have participated in the Great Resignation since 2021, with businesses losing $2+ trillion annually to absenteeism, turnover, and productivity loss. The root cause is the systematic **undervaluation of invisible tasks** that form the backbone of our economy.

**Current evaluation methods fail catastrophically.** Traditional job assessments ignore the hidden complexity of daily tasks‚Äîfrom managing household logistics while working remotely, to the physical toll of "simple" domestic work. These invisible tasks, predominantly performed by women and marginalized groups, are consistently rated as "easy" when they often require extraordinary effort.

**Post-pandemic workforce reality:** With reduced immigration, childcare shortages, and ongoing health impacts, fewer people do more work. Canadian job vacancy rates hit record 5.7% while 15% of workers report long COVID symptoms. In the US, 1.9 million workers are missing due to pandemic-related health issues. **The remaining workforce is overwhelmed, and traditional evaluation systems cannot measure their real burden.**

**The cost of ignorance is staggering:** 
- $300+ billion annually in burnout-related turnover (US alone)
- 40% productivity loss from unrecognized task complexity  
- 70% of healthcare workers report deteriorated mental health

**What's needed is revolutionary:** An objective, scientific system that captures the TRUE difficulty of any task while accounting for individual circumstances and environmental factors. A system that transforms invisible work into measurable, valuable data.
